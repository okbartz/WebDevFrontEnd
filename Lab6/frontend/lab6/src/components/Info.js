                 <p>We are a small local chain of cafes specialising in simple, wholesome, locally sourced dishes.</p>
      <p>A homegrown business, we proved so popular we outgrew our original location and expanded to meet demand. Increased size means we can offer even better value across the Central belt.</p>
        <p>We take pride in providing straightforward, good value food.</p>
        <p>This branch was the first to open in 2016. Since then we have expanded to three other locations - all providing freshly cooked, locally sourced food. We aim to be as sustainable as possible. </p> 
        <p> We are especially proud of our absolutely delicious traditional Italian dishes! Super fresh and indulgent. </p>
        <p> Not to mention our fabulous friendly staff - we look forward to welcoming you soon.</p>
